# Thinking about working in the open

Working in the open means showing people the work we are doing as we are doing it, and sharing afterwards the mistakes and changes we made, as well as the things we learnt on the way. From a service management point of view it also means sharing with the organisation the operational things we are doing, why we are doing them, why (when it happens) something went wrong and why we can't always do the things we would like to do as quickly as others would want.

Working in the open helps us implement good governance around our digital service, providing the organisation and the wider public sector digital community with a window onto our work which, when done right, can help us make our work better.

# How working in the open aligns with our organisational vision and values

At Dorset HealthCare our vision is to be [**better every day through excellence, compassion and expertise in all we do**](https://www.dorsethealthcare.nhs.uk/about-us/vision-and-values-behaviours). But how does this align with working in the open? If we start from a point of working in the open being about *sharing what you know and what you're doing* and *using pre-existing learning from people and organisations*, and this being reciprocal, we see fairly quickly a clear community benefit that contributes to our corporate vision. Through the very acts of sharing and learning, we contribute to a wider community who are all working more or less to this end:

* **excellence** through creating things with an intention of sharing from the outset, building on existing learning and ensuring we don't repeat the mistakes of others, or replicate existing work;
* **compassion** through using the things we create for the benefit of the whole community, remembering that everything is new for someone at some point;
* **expertise** through the very act of sharing, empowering our digital people to be involved in the public sector digital community, to help others and - reciprocally - receive help back.

## Our principles
When we make decisions about working in the open and sharing, we must do so in accordance with our organisational principles which exist to guide our development and decision making. In observance of our principles we:

* **always focus on people first** - working in the open is all about people, as it exists primarily to allow our digital people to share and acquire knowledge and skills;
* **always work in the best interests of our patients** - working in the open helps us, and others, build better and more person-centred digital services and ways of working, creating both direct and indirect benefits to patients;
* **are open and transparent** and **are responsible and accountable for our actions** - this is the very core of working in the open, with as many as possible of the things we do and the decisions we make being visible to the Trust or the wider community;
* **are kind to each other** - through the empowering of our digital people to share the things they create and take an active part in the public sector digital community, we make it easier for them to share, learn and develop across organisational boundaries.

## Our values
The fundamental beliefs that underpin everything we do:

* **working together for patients** and **commitment to quality of care** - being open helps us create better and more person centred digital services to help support care and improve outcomes;
* **respect and dignity** through giving our digital people the autonomy to share and collaborate both inside and outside the organisation as they see fit;
* **compassion** through using the things we create for the benefit of the whole community, remembering that everything is new for someone at some point;
* **improving lives** of our digital people through empowerment, sharing and learning, and of our patients by our improved outputs;
* **everyone counts** when we allow our collaboration to transcend the usual organisational boundaries;
* **commitment to learning** when we share and learn from the things we have done, and others have done.

## Our behaviours
Our core behaviours guide us in bringing our values to life, and help us think about how we approach working in the open

* **Reliable** and **trustworthy** through helping our digital people share their work, learning and expertise, both locally and within the wider digital community;
* **proactive** and **positive** through taking the initiative to do this work, and encouraging the wider digital community within Dorset (and beyond) to do the same;
* **supportive** and **respectful** through being clear that working in the open is something that everyone is empowered to do.
