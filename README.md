# Dorset HealthCare Request for Comments (RFC)

Dorset HealthCare staff can use this repository as a place to share, discuss and make technical decisions.

## Process

1. Create a new branch on this repo and copy `rfc-000-template.md` to `rfc-000-my-proposal.md` and edit.
2. Include any images etc in a separate directory named `rfc-000` and link to them.
3. Make a Pull Request (PR) for your branch.
4. Rename your file and directory with the number of the pull request and push as a new commit.
5. Post a link to your PR in **[Request for Comments](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a13ae9665dac94e09a1924b2f77eaf220%40thread.tacv2/Request%2520for%2520Comments?groupId=2c47d776-6b1e-4383-8355-6767cde93dbc&tenantId=37c354b2-85b0-47f5-b222-07b48d774ee3)** in the **Technical Architecture Group** on Teams.  @mention teams or people if you want particular attention from them.
6. Colleagues discuss your proposal using both inline comments against your RFC document and the general PR comments section. Non-technical staff will need to create a free Github account in order to comment.
7. As changes are requested and agreed in comments, make the changes in your RFC and push them as new commits.
8. Stay active in the discussion and encourage and remind other relevant people to participate. If you’re unsure who should be involved in a discussion, ask your line manager. If you start an RFC it’s up to you to push it through the process and engage people.
9. Once consensus is reached and approvals given using the Github review system, the PR can be merged.
10. When an RFC is accepted, ensure the wider Trust technical community is made aware of it via Teams.
11. An RFC can be rejected. This can happen if a consensus isn’t reached, or people agree rejecting it is the right thing to do. In this case the PR should be closed with a suitable comment.
